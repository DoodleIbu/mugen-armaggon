# mugen-armaggon
An old MUGEN project from 2013 when I barely understood fighting games. I still don't!

## Move list

Armaggon is a 4-button character.
- x = light punch (A)
- y = heavy punch (C)
- a = light kick (B)
- b = heavy kick (D)

### Throws
- b/f + C: Bite (throws forward only)
- b/f + D: Chuck (throws in the direction held)

Throws can be teched out of using b/f + C/D.

### Command normals
- b + B: Shin Kick
  - All grounded normals, aside from his far st.C, can be canceled into this.
- jump, d + C: Yuuei Zutsuki (shark dive)

### Specials
- charge b, f + any punch: Cyclone Wave
- charge b, f + two punches: EX Cyclone Wave (costs 1000 power)
- charge d, u + any kick: Jaws Upper
- charge d, u + any kick: EX Jaws Upper (costs 1000 power)

### Supers
- C+D: Big Wave (costs 2000 power)

### Other
- A+B: Blowback attack (costs 1000 power)
  - A quick invincible attack that launches the opponent away but deals no damage. Can be done while in blockstun, but starts up slower if done in blockstun.
- Start: Taunt

## Additional notes

- Counter hits do additional damage and hitstun. They also cause a single-hit juggle state if the opponent is launched in the air. This is required for getting full damage out of Armaggon's super.

## TODOs

- Random balance changes here and there
  - Review CH state on moves
- Look into some unimplemented mechanics
  - Trip guard (or the lack thereof)
  - Guaranteed throw punishes
- Fixing projectile sound when it gets nullified by other projectiles
- Rip TMNT:TF hit and guard sparks and replace the current ones
- Clean up juggle code
